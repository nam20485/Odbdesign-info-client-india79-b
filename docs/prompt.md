   @plan_docs\OdbDesignInfoClient-API-Integration-Data-Model-Guide.md @plan_docs\REST-API.md @plan_docs\tech-stack.md Implement the app descrobed in the planning issue here:  https://github.com/nam20485/Odbdesign-info-client-india79-b/issues/2 Read the attached documents in as context. They describe the architecture, API integration, data model, and other technical details needed to implement the app. The proto files can be found in  `./protoc` directory. Use them to generate the necessary client code for interacting with the gRPC services defined in the proto files. Make sure to follow best practices for gRPC client implementation and ensure that the app adheres to the specifications outlined in the planning documents. There are directions in the planning documents on how to structure the code, handle API requests, and manage data models. Pay close attention to these details to ensure a successful implementation.
